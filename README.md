# Learning-to-Rank-Problem

Given a set of documents, we try to assign a relevance label to that document such that the document with high relevance is retrieved first. We used linear regression to solve this problem.

We trained our linear regression model using the closed form solution and the stochastic gradient descent to compare how the model is performing under different settings.
